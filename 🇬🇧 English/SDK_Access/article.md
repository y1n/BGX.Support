# SDK Access explained

### What is SDK Access?
***

SDK Access gives you the permission to load unapproved .DLL files (compiled BGX plugins). It's used by developers and their testers to test their plugins before publishing them.

### How to get SDK Access?
***

There's two ways of getting SDK Access, one is if you're developer, the second one is if a developer vouches for you to be their tester.

- If you're a developer who wants to get SDK, please open ticket in our [discord server](https://bgx.gg/discord) and apply using the template below.
#### SDK Access application template for developers:
> - **Are you experienced with C++?**
> - **Have you made scripts for other platforms? If yes, what are these platforms?**
> - **What's your Github? (link)** 
> - **Are you fine with the staff reviewing your plugins/plugins updates before they get published?**

#### There's a few things you need to remember if you want to become a tester:

> - You can't buy SDK access, if someone tries to sell you SDK access, they're trying to scam you.
> - You shouldn't spam developers in their PMs about it. If they want to have you as their tester, you'll know, but anything such as begging/spamming is strictly forbidden.
> - Using SDK Access to have some sort of access to "private plugins" is strictly forbidden.
