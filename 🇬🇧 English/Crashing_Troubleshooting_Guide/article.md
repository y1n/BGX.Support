# Crashing Troubleshooting Guide

### Random crashes || Not injecting completely
***
#### Make sure to turn off all in-game overlays, some examples are:
> "Discord", "OBS", "Overwolf", "Porofessor", "Blitz", "Mobalytics",
> "OP.GG" and "Zar App". The list may be incomplete.

#### If the cause was not in-game overlays, then you can try reinstalling BGX following the steps:

> - Go to %appdata%;
> - Find and delete the random 32 characters folder;
> - Install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35);
> - Download and Install Loader from [BGX Forum](https://forum.bgx.gg/) (you need to be logged in your account);
> - Restart PC;
> - Go in Practise Tool game to make sure everything works good.


### Crashing when loading champion plugin
***

#### Follow the steps below:
> - Open Menu (Default button is "SHIFT"), then go to Core -> Core plugins -> Prediction and then select "Core". If that doesn't work, proceed to step two.
> - Restore config from Loader "Settings" tab (this also applies to plugins that were working before they received an update):
