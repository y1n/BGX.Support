> When you get one of the following error messages, this means
> Something on your side is blocking connection to our Auth server. 
> Some of the things that you could try to resolve it, are the following:

 1. Completely disable Windows Defender (**including "Real-time protection**) - [Antivirus.com article](https://antivirus.com/2021/09/20/how-to-disable-windows-defender/)
 2. Competely disable Windows Firewall - [Microsoft.com article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-microsoft-defender-firewall-on-or-off-ec0844f7-aebd-0583-67fe-601ecf5d774f)
 3. Try to use VPN to inject, then **turn off** the VPN once **RTX** is injected successfully. Good and reliable free option would be something like [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
 4. If nothing of the methods above works, please contact your **ISP** as it'll be very likely that the issue comes directly from them.
